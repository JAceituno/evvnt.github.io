Welcome to the Evvnt Engineering Blog! This is our hello world introducing Evvnt and what we do. First things first, it's not a typo! The company name is Evvnt and it's pronounced Event. (We don't blame you if you pronounce it like [marwage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odMTPuzLwY).)

Our Passion: **Powering Experiences to Connect People**

*People Value Social Interaction Through Local Events that Vitalize Communities and Improve Life Quality*

Q: Why haven't I heard of Evvnt?
A: Today we deliver our software as white labeled. We are on thousands of media sites powering event calendars and selling millions of dollars in tickets.

Q: What makes Evvnt different than any other software company out there?
A: We believe in the following values that we embody every day:
* *Transparency* - we talk about what we do and why at every level in the company
* *Respect* - we believe that each and every person deserves respect and we demonstrate it daily.
* *Ownership* - we believe that a team that owns the company and outcomes is more motivated and makes better decisions.
* *Quality at Pace* - we believe that quality wins over speed and when combined in what we call "Always be shipping", we can build great things that are sustainable and compounding.
* *Integrity* - What you do when no one else is looking matters.
* *Constant Improvement* - If we can improve ourselves, how we work, the product, the company a little bit each day we can go to great places.
* *Customer Focus* - We believe the customer holds the keys to our success and their feedback drives our prioritization
* *Fun* - We believe that we work to support our lives and that life is too short to not enjoy our time together. This means we make space for having fun. And that no meeting is complete without something funny being said.

While all of our values are important and make up who we are, the one that truly sets us apart from other software companies is *Quality at Pace*.

What does Quality at Pace mean as a software engineering team? The best way to answer that is to hear from the team.

> Quality at Pace means we are a agile team that practices Kanban. We don't do sprints. 
> I've seem more quality issues from Sprints. The pressure of the deadline is important for pace, but it often produces 
> sweep it under the rug engineering. We consciously want quality. Things are not done until they work as the they should. 
> This goes for every part of the process. Quality at pace also means we don't talk about deadlines, we talk about priority and order.
> When something makes it into the development queue, you know it will ship as soon as its possible with quality.
> If you are a great engineers/product manager/tester and are sick of the treadmill of sprints, and you have the 
> self discipline to stay focused then Evvnt might be the right place for you.

> To me, quality at pace means buying future agility by taking the time now to _fully_ understand problems, brainstorming an ideal solution (not the quickest!), testing thoroughly against well-understood requirements, and tying up loose ends to meet the true definition of "done". It also means not rubber-stamping pull requests and instead taking the time to dive into the deeper implications of a set of changes.
> Building on top of a robust foundation by prioritizing quality _over_ pace leads to everything on top of the foundation being built that much quicker and that much sturdier.

> -Nick Miller, Senior Software Engineer

> I feel _Quality at Pace_ is a practice shared by all skilled craftsmen, whatever the trade. It means fully understanding the problem and the
> needs of all stakeholders. It means planning ahead, carefully choosing a solution that satisfies the requirements, but recognizes we can't work 
> on one thing indefinitely. It means doing it right the first time and building on a solid foundation. It also means prioritizing the work that 
> will move the product forward and satisfy our long term goals.
