Welcome to the Evvnt xEngineering Blog! This is our hello world introducing Evvnt and what we do. First thing is first, its not a typo! The company name is Evvnt and its pronounced Event. (We don't blame you if you pronounce it like [marwage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odMTPuzLwY).)

Evvnt powers events on (and off) the internet.

Today we provide Marketing and Ticketing for event creators. We do so with a unique model, we partner with local media partners to provide the highest value local marketing for events. Now we may have lost you at events. The space conjurs up images of Perl Jam vs Ticket Master and the seedy re-sale market (also featuring Ticketmaster as the villian).
